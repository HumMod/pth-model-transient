pth-model-transient
===================

A mathematical model of dynamic PTH secretion in response to a calcium function.
Coded in Mathematica.  To be read and executed in sequential order, starting at the top.
Control+Enter runs a code block.
Blocks are denoted by blue bars on the RHS of screen.
For convenience, I am adding a list of about 1,000,000 models as a CSV.
To run, move the model file to your documents directory and import when called for in the mathematica file.
